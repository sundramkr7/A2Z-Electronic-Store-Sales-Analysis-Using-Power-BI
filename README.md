**Order Analysis**

Order Volume by Month: Order volumes fluctuate throughout the year, with a notable peak in December, likely driven by holiday shopping. Other months exhibit varying order levels.

Order Volume by Year: Order volume steadily increased between 2016 and 2019, peaking in 2019. However, there was a significant decline in 2021, warranting further investigation.

**Delivery Time Analysis**

Average Delivery Time: The average delivery time is approximately 4.52 days, ranging from a minimum of 1 day to a maximum of 17 days. However, an anomaly in the data shows an unusually negative average delivery time (-34330.26 days), which requires immediate investigation.

**AOV (Average Order Value) Analysis**

AOV Comparison: The average order value differs between online and in-store sales. Online sales have a lower AOV compared to in-store sales, likely influenced by factors such as product mix, pricing strategies, and customer demographics.

**Seasonal Analysis**

Seasonal Patterns in Order Volume and Revenue: There are clear seasonal trends in order volume and revenue, with December showing a significant peak due to holiday shopping. Understanding these patterns can aid in optimizing inventory levels and tailoring marketing campaigns to maximize revenue during peak seasons.
